## Installation

To install Commerce Countries, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `commercecountries` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/antcooper/commercecountries.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3.  -OR- install with Composer via `composer require antcooper/commercecountries`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
5. The plugin folder should be named `commercecountries` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

Commerce Countries works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.

was to restrict certain products to only ship to certain countries.
